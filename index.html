      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate and driven individual with a strong commitment to personal and professional growth. With a background in Computer Science Engineering, I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. I take pride in being both a critical thinker and a creative mind, always seeking to understand the "why" behind things and explore better ways to get results.
        Over time, I've developed strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills, which help me thrive in team environments and take ownership of tasks. Whether I'm working on a project, learning a new skill, or helping someone solve a challenge, I bring enthusiasm, focus, and a willingness to adapt.
        Outside of work or academics, I enjoy reading, exploring technology trends, traveling and exploring geopolitics. I believe in lifelong learning and continually look for ways to grow both personally and professionally.
        I'm excited about the future and eager to take on new challenges that will push my limits and help me contribute meaningfully to the world around me.
        <!-- Final-year BE CSE student at Chandigarh University with interests in Java, Spring Boot, Android, and Cybersecurity. Strong with OWASP ZAP, Nmap, CVEs, and OpenAI integrations. -->
